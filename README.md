# SpeechText
We shall build a very simple speech recognition system that takes our voice as input and produces the corresponding text by hearing the input.

We will be using Wave2Vec â€” a state-of-the-art speech recognition approach by Facebook.

**Choosing our environment and libraries**

We will be using PyTorch, an open-source machine learning framework for this operation. Similarly, we will use Transformers, a State-of-the-art Natural Language Processing library by Hugging Face.

Below is the list of all the requirements that you might want to install through pip. It is recommended that you install all these packages inside a virtual environment before proceeding.
